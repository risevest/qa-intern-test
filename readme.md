## Instructions:

You are required to test the following 5 user flows. For each flow:

Describe the steps you took.

State the expected result at each step.

Note the actual result you got when testing.

Mark the test as Passed or Failed.

If any issues are found, describe the issue clearly.

### ✅ Test Cases:

- Try logging in using invalid credentials.

- What error message is shown?

2. **View Wallet**

- Is your wallet balance displayed?

- Is it in the right format (e.g., ₦1,000.00)?

3. **Show/Hide Wallet Balance**

- Click again to show the balance.

- Did the visibility change each time?

4. **View Investment Plans**

5. **Create a New Plan**

## ✍️ Deliverables:

## 🕒 Time Duration:

3 days from the day you receive your test credentials.

## 🧪 Bonus (Optional):

If you have any experience in automation testing, feel free to write a simple test script (in any language you know) that tests at least the login page.

## 🔍 Evaluation Criteria:

- Clarity: Are your test steps and results easy to understand?

- Thoroughness: Did you test all the listed flows?

- Attention to Detail: Did you notice any issues or inconsistencies?

- Communication: Are your reports well-written and free of typos?

## Final Note:

This is not a pass/fail test. We are simply looking to understand how you approach testing and documentation. Show us how you think!

Good luck 🎯
